        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Tiffany Tran and I am a pre-business major student. I attend UCR as an undergraduate and am pleased to be a part of the program. Although I must say that like any other student, I do not know for certain which path is right for me. But what I’ve learnt so far in my classes has kept me interested in this major. Also, we have not learnt much about the different concentrations of business but I am intrigued by the vast options that are available to me.<br><br>

         In high school, I had the opportunity to take on a role as historian for a club. In that club I got to document the so called “history” of the development of our little and new club on campus. This role helped me develop leadership skills but most importantly communication skills. I was never the best at freely and openly talking to others only when necessary. But through this leadership position, it made an impact on me and indicated the way to better connect to others, through communicating knowledge and ideas to one another.  I was also in a leadership mentor class that highlighted the overall welfare of all students on campus and how we can have an impact on them. We made it known of the importance of their comfortability and why it mattered to us on campus through events that allowed for students to voice their concerns, have an unwind area to relax in, and hosting events that showed our care for our students. Currently, I am working a part time job.<br><br>

        Through this job, I have developed more skills that can be considered quite useful for any future job I decide to pursue. Skills such as interpersonal, dealing with people inside and outside the organization demonstrating compassion, sympathy, and genuine care by getting to understand the needs and how to motivate. Another skill that I developed while working here, not only the typical customer service skill would be analytical skills. I identify problems, correct problems, and recognize the underlying issue that the problem arises from. Then I make sure to proceed with the best solution satisfying both customers and all workers. I then apply this to my everyday life. Continuously applying this into everything one does in their life helps create a habit of recognizing problems in things such as school work and potential work-related issues. These skills are very useful and helpful no matter what you may do. I also believe being able to communicate in a team or with others is important. Not only will you be working with other people everyday but being able to understand certain situations better and being able to communicate that to others through their work will be essential. One must be able to work with one another to create such networks and connections that will create a better foundation of trust and full effectiveness for a team. I am looking for a creative opportunity that will allow me to solve problems and be able to build upon those problems with solutions that will be beneficial making a positive impact on a bigger scale.
